## Workflow
### Step 1: Understand the Nature of Virtue

**Definition:** A virtue is a stable disposition (habitus) of the soul that perfects a power for good action.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Stable**: Not a fleeting feeling but an enduring quality
- **Disposition**: A settled tendency to act in certain ways
- **Perfecting**: Makes the power work well, toward its proper end
- **For good action**: Directed toward genuine human flourishing

**Virtue vs. Vice:**
- Virtue = good habit (facilitates good action)
- Vice = bad habit (facilitates bad action)

### Step 2: Identify the Cardinal Virtues

The four cardinal (hinge) virtues on which moral life turns:

| Virtue | Power Perfected | Function | Mean Between |
|--------|-----------------|----------|--------------|
| **Prudence** | Practical intellect | Right judgment about what to do | Imprudence / Cunning |
| **Justice** | Will | Render to each what is due | Injustice / Harshness |
| **Fortitude** | Irascible appetite | Face difficulties for the good | Cowardice / Rashness |
| **Temperance** | Concupiscible appetite | Moderate pleasures | Insensibility / Intemperance |

### Step 3: Understand Prudence as Architectonic

**Prudence (Prudentia)** is the "charioteer of the virtues" - without it, the other virtues cannot function properly.

**Three acts of prudence:**
1. **Counsel (deliberatio)**: Gathering relevant information, considering options
2. **Judgment (iudicium)**: Determining what ought to be done
3. **Command (imperium)**: Directing action toward the judged good

**Parts of prudence:**
- Memory (learning from past)
- Understanding (grasping present circumstances)
- Docility (learning from others)
- Shrewdness (quick assessment)
- Reason (connecting principles to cases)
- Foresight (anticipating consequences)
- Circumspection (considering circumstances)
- Caution (avoiding obstacles)

### Step 4: Apply Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance

**Justice (Iustitia):**
- Directed toward others (not oneself)
- Includes: religion (to God), piety (to parents/country), respect (to superiors)
- Parts: commutative (equal exchanges), distributive (proportional distribution), legal (toward common good)

**Fortitude (Fortitudo):**
- Enables pursuit of difficult goods
- Chief act: endurance (sustinere) more than attack (aggredi)
- Includes: magnanimity (great deeds), patience (bearing evils), perseverance (long-term effort)

**Temperance (Temperantia):**
- Moderates attraction to sensible pleasures
- Not suppression but proper ordering
- Includes: abstinence (food), sobriety (drink), chastity (sex), modesty (dress/behavior)

### Step 5: Integrate Theological Virtues

The theological virtues exceed natural capacity and are infused by grace:

| Virtue | Object | Function |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Faith** | God as First Truth | Assent to what God reveals |
| **Hope** | God as Highest Good (to be attained) | Confident expectation of beatitude |
| **Charity** | God as Infinite Good (loved in Himself) | Love of God and neighbor for God's sake |

**Relationship to cardinal virtues:**
- Charity is the "form" of all virtues - it orders all to the ultimate end
- Without charity, cardinal virtues are incomplete (can achieve natural good, not supernatural)
- Charity does not replace but elevates and perfects natural virtues

### Step 6: Develop Practical Application

**To cultivate any virtue:**

1. **Identify the virtue needed** for your situation
2. **Understand its proper object** (what it aims at)
3. **Recognize the opposing vices** (excess and defect)
4. **Practice deliberate acts** (virtue grows through repetition)
5. **Seek good examples** (virtue is learned partly by imitation)
6. **Pray for grace** (especially for theological virtues)

## Example Application

**User question:** "I want to be more courageous but I'm often paralyzed by fear. How do I develop fortitude?"

**Virtue Integration Analysis:**

**Step 1 - Understand fortitude:**
Fortitude is not the absence of fear but the virtue that enables us to face difficulties and dangers for the sake of the good. Fear is natural and appropriate; the question is whether it governs us or we govern it.

**Step 2 - Identify the vices:**
- **Defect (cowardice)**: Allowing fear to prevent doing what is right
- **Excess (rashness)**: Acting without appropriate caution, courting danger unnecessarily

**Step 3 - Connect to prudence:**
Before addressing fortitude, we need prudence:
- Is the feared thing genuinely dangerous?
- Is the good to be pursued worth the risk?
- What is the wisest course of action?

Prudence ensures we are courageous about the RIGHT things.

**Step 4 - Practical development:**

1. **Start small**: Courage is built through practice. Face small fears first (speaking up in a meeting, having a difficult conversation) before larger ones.

2. **Focus on the good, not the fear**: Fortitude is "for the sake of" something. What good are you pursuing? Keep that before your mind.

3. **Cultivate endurance**: The chief act of fortitude is sustinere (bearing/enduring) not aggredi (attacking). Practice patience with difficulty.

4. **Examine your fears**: Many fears are disproportionate to actual danger. Reason can often moderate irrational fear.

5. **Develop connected virtues**:
   - Patience (for long-term challenges)
   - Perseverance (against discouragement)
   - Magnanimity (to attempt great things)

**Step 5 - Theological dimension:**
Natural fortitude enables facing natural evils. But some challenges (persecution, death for the faith) require supernatural fortitude, a gift of the Holy Spirit that perfects the natural virtue.

**Conclusion:** Begin with small, deliberate acts of facing fears for genuine goods. Over time, these acts become easier as the virtue develops. Remember that fortitude is not feeling fearless but acting rightly despite fear.

## The Unity of the Virtues

**Key principle:** The virtues are connected - one cannot fully possess any cardinal virtue without possessing all, because:

1. Prudence is required for all virtues (you cannot be just without knowing what justice requires)
2. All virtues require proper ordering of appetites (temperance and fortitude)
3. All involve rendering what is due (justice)

**Implication:** Work on all virtues together, not just one in isolation.

## Common Objections and Responses

### "Isn't virtue ethics just about feeling good about yourself?"
Virtue is not about feeling but about being and acting well. A virtuous person may feel internal resistance but acts rightly anyway.

### "Can't someone be courageous but unjust (like a brave criminal)?"
This would be "natural" or "imperfect" courage - a natural capacity not yet ordered by prudence and justice. True fortitude is for genuinely good ends.

### "Why do I need theological virtues if I'm already a good person?"
Natural virtues order us to natural goods. But human beings are called to a supernatural end (union with God) that exceeds natural capacity. Theological virtues are needed for this higher calling.

**Related Skills:**
- **natural-law-analysis**: Virtues are habits directing us to fulfill natural law
- **double-effect-reasoning**: Prudence applies double-effect analysis in complex cases
- **faith-reason-synthesis**: Shows relationship between natural and theological virtues

**Skill Interaction:**
Virtue integration provides the character-formation framework that enables living according to natural law. When analyzing specific ethical situations, the virtuous person is one who has the stable dispositions to perceive, judge, and act rightly.
